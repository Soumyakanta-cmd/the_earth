                <h2> History</h2><br>
                <P>The history of Earth began about 4.54 billion years ago, when the planet formed from a cloud of dust and gas around the Sun. In its early stage, Earth was very hot and covered with molten rock and volcanoes, and the Moon formed after a giant impact. Over time, the planet cooled, forming a solid crust and oceans. Simple life, like single-celled organisms, appeared over 3 billion years ago and slowly made oxygen, changing the atmosphere and allowing more complex life to develop. Plants, animals, and then dinosaurs lived on Earth before mammals became the main animals after the dinosaurs died out. Modern humans have lived on Earth for only a tiny part of its long historyâ€”less than 1 million years</P>
